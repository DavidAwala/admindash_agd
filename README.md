# AdminDash (Vite + React)

This is a small Vite + React demo project for the AdminDash UI you provided. It includes Tailwind CSS, lucide-react icons and Recharts for charts.

Getting started:

1. Install dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. Open the printed local URL in your browser (usually http://localhost:5173).

Notes:
- The AI assistant in the app uses a placeholder fetch URL and an empty API key; provide your runtime API key to enable it.
- Tailwind is configured via PostCSS and the app uses the `dark` class on the root element to toggle dark mode.
